Charlotte's Chart is a simple tool to generate a spider chart

# Why?
I needed to add a Spider Chart to a Google Spreadsheet and the available Radar Chart didn't achieve a good result.

Then I guessed it would be great to have a REST service which I could call and get a PNG back with the plotted chart.
